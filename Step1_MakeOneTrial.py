#### ---- JULIANA -SEE STEP2 FOR WORK. 
#%% Required set up
# this imports everything you might need and opens a full screen window
# when you are developing your script you might want to make a smaller window
# so that you can still see your console
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import os, sys
from psychopy import visual, core, event, gui, logging

# open a white full screen window
win = visual.Window(fullscr=True, allowGUI=False, color='white', unit='height')

# uncomment if you use a clock. Optional because we didn't cover timing this week,
# but you can find examples in the tutorial code
#trialClock = core.Clock()

#%% up to you!
# this is where you build a trial that you might actually use one day!
# just try to make one trial ordering your lines of code according to the
# sequence of events that happen on one trial
# if you're stuck you can use the responseExercise.py answer as a starting point

# maybe start by making stimulus objects (e.g. myPic = visual.ImageStim(...))

# then draw all stimuli

# then flip your window

# then record your responses


#%% Required clean up
# this cell will make sure that your window displays for a while and then
# closes properly

core.wait(2)
win.close()
